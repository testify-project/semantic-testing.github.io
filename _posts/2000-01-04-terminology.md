## Terminology
Before we proceed, let me introduce some important terms that will use:

**Software Bug**

A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

**System Under Test**

System Under Test (SUT) refers to a system that is being tested for correct operation.

**Test**

A collection of test cases to validate a system under test functionality.

**Test Case**

A test case is a set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results used to determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

**Collaborator**

A collaborator is any system required by the system under test to fulfill its duties.

**Fake Collaborator**

A fake collaborator is a collaborator whose behavior is altered to simulate the behavior of a real collaborator for testing purposes.

**Virtual Collaborator**

A virtual collaborator is a collaborator that behaves like a real collaborator behaves unless its behavior is altered for testing purpose.

**Real Collaborator**

A real collaborator is collaborator that behaves like a real collaborator would behave.

**Resource**

A resource is any asset drawn on by a the system under test to fulfill its duties.

**Local Resource**

A local resource is an asset that is:
* managed locally
* simulates a deployment environment resource
* without external interactions and dependencies

**Virtual Resource**

A virtual resource is a resource that is:
* managed locally or remotely
* similar to the deployment environment resource

**Remote Resource**

A remote resource is an asset that is:
* managed remotely
* identical to the deployment environment resource

**Analyzer**

An analyzer is any tool drawn on by a test to examine the system under test or test cases identify potential software bugs.

**Goal**

A goal defines a broad primary outcome you want to achieve.

**Objective**

An objective is a specific and measurable step you take to prove you are effectively achieving a goal.

**Strategy**

A strategy is an approach you take to achieve an objective.

**Tactic**

A tactic is a tool you use to achieve a strategy.
