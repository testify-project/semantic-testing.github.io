## What is Semantic Testing?

Semantic Testing is the belief that software testing is not idiosyncratic. Testing a web application at Company X is the same as testing a web application at Company Y. The software may be different in form, function, and deployemtn environment but how you fundamentally test the software is the same. This belief holds true whether you are testing a library, a SaaS, an RPC client/server, a cloud service, a mobile application, or AI software.

Semantic Testing applies systems thinking to develop a software testing specification that prescribes habits and practices to effectively test your software. At the heart of Semantic Testing is the concept that all test cases can be categorized into five testing categories with a specific goal, objectives, strategies and tactics. These testing categories are:

* Unit Test
* Integration Test
* System Test
* Safety Test
* Experience Test
