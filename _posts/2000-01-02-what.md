#### What is Semantic Testing?

Semantic testing is born out of the belief that software testing is not idiosyncratic. Testing a web application at company X is the same as testing a web application at company Y. Sure, there are differences in function, configuration and environment between software implementations but how you fundamentally test the software is the same. This belief holds true whether you are testing a library, an RPC client/server, a mobile application, or autonomous vehicle software. 

Semantic testing applies systems thinking to software testing and develops a set of habits and practices within a framework that easy to understand by software developers to effectively test software. Fundamentally there are five levels of software testing regardless of the kind of software being written. These levels are:

1. Unit Test
1. Integration Test
1. System Test
1. Safety Test
1. Experience Test
