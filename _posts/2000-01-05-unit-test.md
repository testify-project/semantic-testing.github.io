## Unit Test

**Goal**

Insure the smallest unit of code behaves exactly as you expect in isolation.

**Objectives**

* Implement one or more test cases that causes the unit of code to fail
* Implement one or more test cases that causes the unit of code to passes
* Deliver production code that has at least 80% code coverage

**Strategies**

* Assert external resources are not used
* Assert test cases can be executed independent of other test cases
* Assert the result produced by the unit of code
* Assert the state of stateful objects
* Assert interaction between the system under test and its collaborators

**Tactics**

* Utilize clean coding practices
* Utilize a testing framework
* Utilize fake or virtual collaborators to simulate certain behaviors
* Utilize an assertion library
* Utilize a code coverage tool
* Utilize a mutation testing tool
