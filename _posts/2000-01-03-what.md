#### What is Semantic Testing?

Semantic testing is born out of the belief that software testing is not idiosyncratic. Testing a web application at company X is the same as testing a web application at company Y. Software may be different in form, function, and environment but how you fundamentally test the software is the same. This belief holds true whether you are testing a library, third-party SaaS, an RPC client/server, a mobile application, or AI software.

Semantic testing applies systems thinking to software testing to develop a framework that prescribes habits and practices that are easy to understand to effectively test software. At the heart of Semantic Testing is the idea that all software test cases can be categorized into five testing levels and have specific goals, strategy, objectives and tactics:

* Unit Test
* Integration Test
* System Test
* Safety Test
* Experience Test
